1. Universal Clipboard Sync
When you copy/cut on one device, it’s instantly available to Clipboard on any other device (using WebSocket broadcast).
Optionally, keep a clipboard history (locally or synced). 
2. QR Code Clipboard Bridge
Instantly generate a QR code for the current clipboard or selected text, so you can scan and transfer text to a mobile device without network sync.
3. Device Pairing & Auth
Pair devices with a simple code or QR scan for secure, private clipboard sync (no accidental sharing).
4. Drag & Drop File Transfer
Drag a file onto the notepad to upload, and generate a download link or QR code for other devices.
5. Markdown/Code Mode
Toggle between plain text, Markdown preview, or code syntax highlighting for code snippets.
6. Quick Actions
“Copy as…” (Base64, JSON, URL-encoded, etc.)
“Paste and Search” (Google, StackOverflow, etc.)
“Paste and Run” (for code snippets, with sandboxed output)
7. Hotkey-Driven UI
Everything accessible via keyboard shortcuts, with a command palette (like VS Code’s Ctrl+Shift+P).
8. Clipboard Sharing Room
Create a temporary “room” (with a Clipboard ) for quick, secure sharing with friends or colleagues.
9. End-to-End Encryption
Optionally encrypt clipboard content before syncing between devices.
10. Clipboard Expiry & Auto-Clear
Set clipboard items to expire after X minutes for privacy.
